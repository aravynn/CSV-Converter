CSV Converter

Created by Kevin Jones for MEP Brothers Ltd.
Console only application, running on windows, but would likely work on nearly 
any operating system that can run console applications.

Summary: The CSV converter is a limited-use program developed for rapid conversion
of large-scale HTML files, drawn from PDF files, to output CSV files destined for 
upload to a WooCommerce Wordpress installation. 

--

Project includes: This project is designed to take 3 pre-formatted files, one, an
HTML file containing pre-defined sections as converted from a PDF. Two, a CSV file
containing the part numbers and a few other peices of information about the relevant 
part numbers to be uploaded to WooCommerce, and finally, an output CSV file. 

This program will then find and parse the HTML file to create a valid file for upload 
to WooCommerce, containing only the part number required from the Origin CSV.

Status and To-Do: This project is very use limited and is not designed for use beyond 
the pre-defined files created for its development. This project works, however only if 
the strict formatting of all files involved is followed. 

To-Do: This project's purpose has been completed. If required again, it will likely need 
to be tweaked for the next set of files.
